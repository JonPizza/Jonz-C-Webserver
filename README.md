# Jonz C Webserver

This is a webserver that will never:

 - Give you up
 - Let you down
 - Run around
 - Desert you
 - Make you cry
 - Say goodbye
 - Tell a lie
 - Hurt you

As well as:

 - Serve files in the "webroot" directory ('/' at the end is madatory)
 - Return either 404 or 200
 - Ignore most request headers
 - Having a CSP, so XSS will be particuarly hard, although you will have to only include JavaScript files from your origin.
 - Has directory traversal protection
 - Doesn't support URL encoding
 - Probably has a memory leak
 - Serves everything over port 6969

Enjoy!
